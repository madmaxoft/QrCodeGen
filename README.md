# QrCodeGen
QR code generator in C++

This is a fork of [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library)'s C++ QR code generator, simplified for minimum effort needed when embedding into another C++ codebase. Simply add this repo as a submodule into your project and add the three CPP files to you build system.
